# Coding Dojo Solo Project
## Personal website with blog-like posts
### Phase 1 - Basic site
The project that I'll be turning in is pretty basic, but I plan to expand upon it past the Project & Algorithms course. 

The site will have 3 pages




## General setup
- ~~rename project folder~~
- ~~set up github repo for main project folder~~

## Client setup
- ~~cd PROJECT-FOLDER-NAME~~
- ~~npx create-react-app client~~
- ~~cd client~~
- ~~npm i axios react-router-dom~~
- npm start to start the frontend server
- ctrl c to stop

## Server setup
- ~~create .gitignore, add /node_modules~~
- ~~npm i express mongoose cors~~
- ~~create database, probably in compass~~
- ~~go through and rename everything labeled RENAME~~
- ~~update database name in mongoose.config.js~~
- cd server
- nodemon server.js to start the backend server
- ctrl c to stop


### Notes
frontend pages:
- ~~/~~
- ~~/about~~
- ~~/post~~
- ~~/post/:id~~
- ~~/post/create~~
- ~~/post/edit/:id~~

components:
- ~~homepage~~
- ~~about~~
- ~~displayAll~~
- ~~displayOne~~
- ~~createOne~~
- ~~editOne~~
- ~~nav/header~~

### To Do
- update hero images on all pages
    - so, find actual images
- style up detail page
- ~~favicon~~
- ~~create footer component~~
- ~~content to homepage and style it up~~
- ~~content to about and style it up~~
    - basic, no hero I think. Profile pic with that css animation, about content on the right.
- ~~style up list page~~
- ~~fix head description, still says react app~~
- ~~can delete the homepage.css stylesheets, don't need it since everything is now in the hero component~~
- ~~set up component for hero image, use on every page~~
- ~~update the navigate on CreateOne, so it'll go to post's detail page~~
- ~~posts by most recent on top, backend in controller file I think~~
- ~~update hero component, new props to add in button~~
