# Coding Dojo Solo Project
## Personal website with blog-like posts
### Phase 1 - Basic site
The project that I'll be turning in is pretty basic, but I plan to expand upon it past the Project & Algorithms course. 

The site will have 3 pages




## General setup
- ~~rename project folder~~
- ~~set up github repo for main project folder~~

## Client setup
- ~~cd PROJECT-FOLDER-NAME~~
- ~~npx create-react-app client~~
- ~~cd client~~
- ~~npm i axios react-router-dom~~
- npm start to start the frontend server
- ctrl c to stop

## Server setup
- ~~create .gitignore, add /node_modules~~
- ~~npm i express mongoose cors~~
- ~~create database, probably in compass~~
- ~~go through and rename everything labeled RENAME~~
- ~~update database name in mongoose.config.js~~
- cd server
- nodemon server.js to start the backend server
- ctrl c to stop
