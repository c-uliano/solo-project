# Coding Dojo Solo Project
## Personal website with blog-like posts
### Phase 1 - Basic site
The project that I'll be turning in is pretty basic, but I plan to expand upon it past the Project & Algorithms course. 

The site will have 3 main pages, the homepage, about, and posts. Create post and edit post pages are also present.
- The homepage will showcase my skills, education, and some sample portfolio pieces
- The about page will have a brief blurb about myself, a profile pic, and the sample portfolio pieces again
- The Posts page will list out all the posts, with a button in the hero where you can create a new post
- All posts can be edited or deleted

### Phase 2 - Adding registration & login
Down the road I'd like to learn how to do registration and login so I can actually deploy this as my personal website, logging in to post updates whenever I want.
