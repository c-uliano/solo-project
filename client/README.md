## Updates to make
- Create nav link component to use within the HeaderNav
  - Set up props for text, various hover effects, colors, and option to include an icon. Nav links could be just an icon too. And a prop for if it needs to open in new window, determining if the nav link will be a Link or an anchor tag
  - Make an array of objects with all the link text, url, specific icon, and then map through them to spit out the new nav link component with the cooresponding data
- Update Hero component
  - Same option with the button link, to be a Link or an anchor tag
    - Should that be some kind of props option for a Button component - if the button component has a link to navigate to then a prop to determine if it can be a Link or an anchor tag (most useful for links that need to open a new tab, probably to outside site)
- Update the app to use TypeScript? Or create a version using TypeScript
- Make/make use of reusable components
  - Create Button component
  - Create Input component
  - Create Textarea component
  - Create Select component
  - OR try out a component library like React Bootstrap or Material UI
- Portfolio component is like a card component, expand upon that
  - Update the `portfolioList` to be an array of objects instead of an array of arrays
